# Tehran-House-Price-Prediction-with-XGBoost
This repository provides a comprehensive solution for predicting the prices of houses in Tehran using the 'Divar' dataset and employing the XGBoost machine learning algorithm. The project aims to assist individuals, real estate agents, and property investors in estimating the market value of residential properties in Tehran.

## 1.Data Collection: 
The repository includes scripts and guidelines for collecting the necessary data from the 'Divar' platform, which is a popular online marketplace for buying and selling properties in Tehran.

## 2.Data Preprocessing: 
The collected data undergoes preprocessing steps to handle missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues. This includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and feature selection to create a robust dataset for training the prediction model.

## 3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
EDA techniques are applied to gain insights into the dataset, identify patterns, and understand the relationships between different features. Visualizations and statistical summaries are utilized to extract meaningful information from the data.

## 4.Model Development: 
The XGBoost algorithm, known for its excellent performance in regression tasks, is employed to build the house price prediction model. The repository provides a detailed implementation of the XGBoost model using appropriate hyperparameter tuning techniques for optimal performance.

## 5.Model Evaluation: 
The developed model is rigorously evaluated using various evaluation metrics to assess its accuracy and generalization capabilities. Cross-validation techniques are employed to validate the model's performance and mitigate overfitting.

## 6.Deployment and Inference: 
The repository guides users on deploying the trained model into a production environment, allowing them to make real-time predictions on new, unseen data. Sample inference code and instructions for incorporating the model into applications or services are provided.

## 7.Documentation and Examples: 
Detailed documentation is included to guide users through each step of the project, including instructions on setting up the environment, running the code, and interpreting the results. Additionally, example notebooks or scripts demonstrate the end-to-end workflow of data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

## 8.Contribution and Extension: 
The repository encourages contributions from the community to enhance the project further. Users can suggest improvements, add new features, or propose alternative models for house price prediction in Tehran.

By using this repository, individuals interested in the Tehran housing market can leverage the power of machine learning and the XGBoost algorithm to estimate property prices accurately, aiding in decision-making processes related to buying, selling, or investing in residential properties in Tehran.
